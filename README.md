# RegretDataAnalysis
This package provides a set of tools written in Matlab for analyzing the data measured in the RegretMeasurement-GUI.  

The folder structure must be maintained the same during downloading. The content should be downloaded to the same folder (directory). 

*********************************************************IMPORTANT**************************************************************
The data stored in the "ParticipantsRegretData" folder in the "RegretMeasurement-GUI" package should be copied and pasted to the "Database" folder in the current package. 
********************************************************************************************************************************

There is some sample data sets to help you learn how to run these tools. 

The toolbox contains 7 tools:
1. OutcomeDataCleanTool (Optional)
2. ProbabilityDataCleanTool (Optional)
3. Learn_Random
4. Plot_Q
5. ValidationPerformance
6. TrainingPerformance
7. ShowMembership_EquallyLiked

The first 2 tools are optional. They are provided to assist in cleaning data. Learn_Random is important and it takes longest time to execute, ranging from seconds to hours depending on your setting. Learn_Random should also be run before the following programs, since the last four tools rely on the result calculated in Learn_Random. 

The SupplementaryPrograms stores some subroutines of the tools, so be careful to maintain the folder-structure. 

The Gallery folder is used to store all the figures you may make.

This tutorial may be confusing. Since I do not expect there are many of you would like to download these files, I do not take the effort to write a clear tutorial. But you really want to use them, I am more than happy to assist you. Just shoot me an email at the following address.
